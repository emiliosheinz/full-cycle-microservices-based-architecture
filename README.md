# Microservices-based Architecture

Microservices architecture is a design approach in software development where a large application is composed of small, loosely coupled, and independently deployable services. Each service is usually responsible for a specific business functionality and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs. This architecture enables organizations to develop, deploy, and scale parts of the application independently, facilitating continuous delivery and deployment, enhancing fault isolation, and enabling the use of diverse technologies and platforms suited to each service's requirements[^1].
